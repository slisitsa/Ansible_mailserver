# Fail2Ban filter for repeated founds on subnets
#
# This filter monitors the fail2ban-subnet log file, and enables you to add long 
# time bans for /24 subnet addresses that get found by fail2ban multiple times.
#
# Reasons to use this: block very persistent attacker subnets for a longer time, 
# stop receiving email notifications about the same attacker subnet over and 
# over again.
#
